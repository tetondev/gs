      <p>If not renewed, your judgments as well as real and personal property lien positions will expire or become void anywhere between 5 and 20 years after they were issued, depending on the state where they were initially filed.  Keeping track of when multiple judgments from various states will need to be renewed can become a difficult task when relying only upon a spreadsheet as your tracking mechanism.</p>
      <p>Programmed with all of the pertinent expiration details from each state, the Guaranty Solutions Judgment Management System allows you to run reports on your full portfolio to see which judgments or liens will expire in the next three, six or twelve months.</p>
